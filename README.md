# Module-3-Challenge

## Description
This is a password generater that will prompt the user for a password length that is between 8 and 128. Afterwards, the program will confirm if the user wants uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or/and special characters. Finally, it will take these inputs and randomly generate the password following the selected criteria.  

## Usage
The user will type in a number between 8 and 128 in the prompt. Then, they will be prompted about each character the user wants by selecting "Ok" or "Cancel". Clicking "Ok" confirms that the group of characters will be included and "Cancel" excludes the characters from the password. The user's new password will be outputed via an alert box for them to see.
